# Time Doctor API Authentication Debug Results

## üîç Current Status

‚úÖ **Login Working** - Successfully authenticating with Time Doctor API  
‚ùå **Token Not Working** - Token from auth-v1.3 not compatible with v1.0 endpoints

## üìä What We Found

### Login Response
```json
{
  "data": {
    "token": "1UqAqz7XfnnYXdp1OwprvWvqOhE8fD7hn_tA2r1eCIio",
    "expiresAt": "2026-03-01T07:47:35.405Z",
    "createdAt": "2025-09-02T07:47:35.405Z"
  },
  "api": "auth-v1.3"  // ‚Üê Note: auth-v1.3, not v1.0
}
```

### Error When Using Token
```json
{
  "error": "invalidToken",
  "message": "Token ID is invalid or access is denied."
}
```

## üîë The Issue

Time Doctor has **multiple API versions** that aren't fully compatible:
- **auth-v1.3**: New authentication system (what login returns)
- **v1.0**: API endpoints for users, projects, etc.

The token from auth-v1.3 is not directly usable with v1.0 endpoints.

## üõ†Ô∏è Solutions to Try

### Option 1: Use Time Doctor's Web Interface Token
1. Log in to https://webapi.timedoctor.com
2. Open Developer Tools (F12)
3. Go to Network tab
4. Make any API request in the UI
5. Look for the Authorization header in the request
6. Copy that token and use it directly

### Option 2: Exchange Token (Possible Flow)
The auth-v1.3 token might need to be exchanged:
```javascript
// Try this endpoint to get workspace/company info
POST https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.3/companies
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN

// Then use the company ID to get a v1.0 compatible token
POST https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/auth/company/{companyId}
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN
```

### Option 3: Use Different Login Endpoint
Try the older login endpoint:
```javascript
POST https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.1/authorization/login
{
  "email": "your-email",
  "password": "your-password"
}
```

### Option 4: OAuth Flow
Time Doctor might require OAuth for production use:
1. Register your application at Time Doctor
2. Get client_id and client_secret
3. Use OAuth flow to get access token

## üìù Updated Test Script

The `manual-test.js` now tries 5 different authentication methods:
1. Bearer Token (standard)
2. Token without Bearer prefix
3. X-Access-Token header
4. Token as query parameter
5. Api-Key header

Run it to see which method works:
```bash
node manual-test.js
```

## üîÑ Next Steps

1. **Contact Time Doctor Support**
   - Ask about v1.3 to v1.0 token compatibility
   - Request API documentation for the auth flow
   - Get clarification on company/workspace selection

2. **Check Time Doctor Dashboard**
   - Look for API keys or tokens in account settings
   - Check if API access needs to be enabled
   - Look for OAuth application registration

3. **Try Alternative Endpoints**
   ```bash
   # Test with v1.3 endpoints
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.3/users"
   
   # Test with v1.1 endpoints
   curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
        "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.1/users"
   ```

4. **Use Browser Network Inspector**
   - Log in to Time Doctor web app
   - Open Network tab in DevTools
   - Perform actions and capture the actual API calls
   - Copy the working Authorization header

## üí° Workaround

Until we resolve the token issue, you can:
1. Use the Time Doctor web interface to get a working token
2. Hard-code a working token for testing
3. Use Time Doctor's official SDK if available
4. Contact their support for proper API access

Subject: API Token Compatibility Issue - auth-v1.3 vs v1.0

Hi Time Doctor Support,

I'm integrating with your API and successfully logging in via:
POST https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/login

This returns a token with "api": "auth-v1.3", but when I use this token with:
GET https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/users

I get: "Token ID is invalid or access is denied."

Questions:
1. How do I use the auth-v1.3 token with v1.0 endpoints?
2. Is there a token exchange process required?
3. Do I need to select a company/workspace first?
4. Is there updated documentation for this auth flow?

Thank you!
```
