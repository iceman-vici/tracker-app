## üõ†Ô∏è Available Scripts

- Try alternative endpoints (members, team-members, activity)
- Check for permission endpoints
- Find workarounds for user data

### 2. **time-doctor-working.js** - Test All Endpoints
```bash
node time-doctor-working.js
```
Tests all standard endpoints to see what's accessible.

### 3. **manual-test.js** - Debug Tool
```bash
node manual-test.js
```
Comprehensive debugging with detailed output.

## üîÑ Workarounds for User Data

Since the users endpoint has permission issues, try these alternatives:

### Option 1: Activity Endpoint (Often includes user data)
```bash
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/activity?token=TOKEN&company=68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6&start=2025-09-01&end=2025-09-02"
```

### Option 2: Worklogs Endpoint (Includes user references)
```bash
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/worklogs?token=TOKEN&company=68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6&start=2025-09-01&end=2025-09-02"
```

### Option 3: Projects Endpoint (May include assignees)
```bash
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/projects?token=TOKEN&company=68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6"
```

## üìù Next Steps

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Run `fix-permissions.js`** to find alternative endpoints
2. **Check Time Doctor Dashboard** for API permissions settings
3. **Use working endpoints** like companies, projects, activity

Subject: API Users Endpoint Permission Issue

Hi Time Doctor Support,

I'm successfully authenticated with the API and can access the companies endpoint where I have "owner" role. However, the users endpoint returns:

403: "You don't have permission to perform this action"

Details:
- Token is valid (companies endpoint works)
- Company ID: 68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6
- Role: owner
- Endpoint: /api/1.0/users?token=TOKEN&company=COMPANY_ID

Questions:
1. Does the users endpoint require additional permissions?
2. Is there a setting in my Time Doctor account to enable user data access?
3. Are there alternative endpoints for getting user/member data?

Thank you!
```

## üöÄ Quick Test Commands

Test these with your current token:

```bash
# Working - Companies
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/companies?token=YOUR_TOKEN"

# Not Working - Users (403 error)
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/users?token=YOUR_TOKEN&company=68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6"

# Try These Alternatives:
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/me?token=YOUR_TOKEN"
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/activity?token=YOUR_TOKEN&company=68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6&start=2025-09-01&end=2025-09-02"
curl "https://api2.timedoctor.com/api/1.0/worklogs?token=YOUR_TOKEN&company=68b1cb4ae86c38faec59b7f6&start=2025-09-01&end=2025-09-02"
```

## üìä Summary

- ‚úÖ **Authentication working** - Token is valid
- ‚úÖ **Company access confirmed** - Owner role verified
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Users endpoint blocked** - Permission issue despite owner role
- üîç **Investigating alternatives** - Activity and worklogs may provide user data

The authentication is working correctly, but Time Doctor's permission system is blocking the users endpoint. This appears to be an API configuration issue on Time Doctor's side that may require:
1. Account settings adjustment
2. API permission enablement
3. Support team assistance

Run `fix-permissions.js` to explore alternative endpoints that might provide the user data you need!
